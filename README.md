## 📌 Introduction

This project is a text-based number guessing game. A random number between 1 and 100 is generated by the computer, and the user has to guess what it is. After each guess, the game provides feedback whether the number is higher or lower. After guessing correctly, the player can choose to play again.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x (tested on Python 3.8+)  
- No external libraries required – uses Python’s built-in `random` module

---

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).  
2. Clone this repository or copy the Python script (`guess_the_number.py`) manually.  
3. Open your terminal or command prompt in the script's directory.

---

## 🚀 Usage

To run the game, execute:

```bash
python guess_the_number.py
```

- You'll be prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100.
- The game gives feedback after each guess.
- After guessing correctly, you can choose to play again.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. The script generates a random number between 1 and 100.  
2. It repeatedly prompts the user for a guess.  
3. If the input is not a number, it asks again.  
4. If the guess is too low, it prints “Higher!”.  
5. If the guess is too high, it prints “Lower!”.  
6. If the guess is correct, it prints “You guessed it!” and asks if you want to play again.

## 🛠️ Configuration

There are no special configurations required. However, you can change the range of numbers or the default behavior by modifying these lines in the script:

```python
random_number = random.randint(1, 100)  # You can change the range here from a to b
```

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- **Problem:** The game doesn't start  
  **Solution:** Make sure Python is installed and accessible from your terminal.

- **Problem:** Input is ignored  
  **Solution:** Ensure you're entering valid numbers. The game only accepts numeric inputs.
